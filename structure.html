		<p><b>What is markup?</b></p>
		<p> Markup is used to define specific elements such as headings, paragraphs and fonts 
		by using tags such as &ltp> to represent paragraphs and &lth1> to represent headings. </p>
				
		<p><b>What is hypertext and hypermedia?</b></p>
		<p>Hypertext and hypermedia are used as links which direct you to other websites from </p>
		<p> the one you have created. An example of Hypertext would be </p> <a href "https://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=yvTvV82jGs_U8gfc976ICQ"> this </a>
				
		<p><b>What is a doctype and why is it important to include it in every HTML document?</b></p>
		<p>When you add &ltdoctype> at the start of your HTML file you are declaring what version of 
		HTML it has been written in so that the browsers which it is opened in knows what to expect. </p>
				
		<p><b>What language can be used to style web documents?</b></p>
		<p> CSS </p>
				
		<p><b>Which elements are required for a valid XHTML5 document?</b></p>
		<p> doctype
		<p> html </p>
		<p> title </p>
		<p> head </p>
		<p> body </p>
				
		<p><b>What is a self closing HTML element? Give an example?</b></p>
		<p> Some elements used in HTML do not require a closing tag such as &lt/p> 
		and can closed without. An example of this would be with the &ltlink element 
		which is closed with /> instead of &lt/link> </p>
				
		<p><b>What is XML and why is it important to web developers?</b></p>
		<p> XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language and is structured in a similar way to HTML
		The difference between XML and HTML is the fact that XML allows you to define your own tags 
		instead of using the generic tags you'd normally use in HTML. For example... </p>
				
		<p><code>&ltnote></code></p> 
				
		<p><code>&ltto>Tove&lt/to> </code></p> 
		<p><code>&ltfrom>Jani&lt/from> </code></p> 
		<p><code>&ltheading>Reminder&lt/heading> </code></p> 
		<p><code>&ltbody>Don't forget me this weekend!&lt/body> </code></p> 
		<p><code>&lt/note></code>
				
		<p> Notice how instead of using tags such as &lth1> I used &ltheading> instead. XML allows you to 
		create custom tags in your script to simplify the creation of your site. </p>
				
		<p><b>Describe 4 XML rules?</b></p>
		<p> 1. Elements must be properly nested. </p> 
		<p> 2. Elements must have a start and end tag. </p>
		<p> 3. Element names are case-sensitive. </p>
		<p> 4. Attribute values must be enclosed in double quotation marks. </p>
				
		<p><b>What is the difference between a "well-formed" and a valid web document?</b></p>
		<p> A well formed XML document is one where everything in the document is used correctly with no errors 
		this includes opening and closing tags in their correct order and the HTML version is declared on the first line with &ltdoctype> 
		A valid document is where the the document is well-formed but also follows the rules of a specific doctype. </p>

		<h1>The different Elements in this html</h1>
				
		<p><b> &ltp> </b></p>
		<p> &ltp> is used to define standard paragraphs and sentences in your html document such as this one. </p>
				
		<p><b> &lth1> </b></p>
		<p> &lth1> is used to create headings in html. You can modify the number from &lth1> to &lth6> to alter the </p>
		<p> size of your heading with 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest </p>
				
		<p><b> &lthead> </b></p>
		<p> &lthead> is where you define the things which you do not see on the website itself  such as the charset you use 
		and also the text which appears on the tab of your web browser. Nothing you include here will appear on the page itself. 
		it is purely used for metadata </p>
				
		<p><b> &ltbody> </b></p>
		<p> &ltbody> is where all of the visible content within your website which you actually view on the web browser is found </p>
